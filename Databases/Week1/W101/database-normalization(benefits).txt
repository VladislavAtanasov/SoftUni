Benefits of DB Normalization:
    - it frees the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies;
    - it reduces the need for restructuring the collection of relations, as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs;
    - it makes the relational model more informative to users;
    - it makes the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.
