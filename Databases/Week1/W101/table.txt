	A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.

Differencies between table and relation:
	An SQL table can potentially contain duplicate rows, whereas a true relation cannot contain duplicate tuples. Similarly, representation as a table implies a particular ordering to the rows and columns, whereas a relation is explicitly unordered.
